# Disney Movies Giftastic
### Link to site: [GifTastic](https://jenharden.github.io/GifTastic/)

### Description:
```
This is a nice site to explore your love for Disney movies, in gif form.  This site allows you to click on 
an existing movie button to load 10 random gifs for that movie.  You can also add your own movies and 
generate gifs for all of the Disney movies you love.  

The gifs will load as "still" images initially, but if you click a gif then you will see the animation of 
the gif.  If you want to stop the animation, just click the gif again.  

If you would like to know the rating of any gif, hover over the gif, and you will see the rating displayed.
